### Swift-Command-Line-Playground
It's a simple example for showing some basic API we can use while making a Swift Command Line Tool.

I have separated each part into different commits.
You can check out each commit step to try each part:
1. How to echo
2. How to read the arguments
3. How to read/write environments
4. How to get current position
5. How to run bash script inside Swift command line.
